# My Fullstack App - Frontend

This is the frontend part of the My Fullstack App, built using React. This application communicates with the backend API to provide a seamless user experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-fullstack-app.git

   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
